This is based on the Data Science in VS Code tutorial from Microsoft https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial

It was created using VSCode online through Github codespaces. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/notebooks-web

I have extended the tutorial's example to fit with the DAHL reseeach framework, so that we have an example of exploring human stories in close-up, and an example of looking for patterns in big data.
